/**
 * @title Polls Contract
 * @notice This contract manages decentralized voting polls, supporting direct voting,
 *         delegate voting, and meta-transactions for gasless interactions.
 * @dev The contract integrates multiple modules for voting, delegation, proposal management,
 *      and cross-chain bridging. It allows the contract owner to set a bridge contract for
 *      cross-chain operations and a meta-transaction handler for gasless voting.
 *
 * Inherits:
 * - Ownable: Ensures that certain functions can only be called by the contract owner.
 * - RightToVote: Manages voting rights and eligibility.
 * - Delegations: Supports delegated voting where users can allow others to vote on their behalf.
 * - PollHelpers, ProposalHelpers, PredictionHelpers, Predictions, PredictionBetHelpers, PredictionBets:
 *   Provide additional functionality for proposal and prediction management within polls.
 *
 * Features:
 * - **Direct Voting:** Users can cast votes directly for a specified proposal within a poll.
 * - **Delegate Voting:** Allows designated delegates to vote with delegated power on behalf of others.
 * - **Meta-Transaction Voting:** Supports gasless voting by allowing an authorized meta-transaction handler
 *   to submit votes on behalf of users.
 * - **Cross-Chain Bridging:** Finalized poll results can be bridged to another blockchain using a specified
 *   bridge contract.
 *
 * Events:
 * - `VoteSubmitted`: Emitted whenever a vote is cast, logging the poll ID, voter address, and vote details.
 * - `PollFinalized`: Emitted when a poll is finalized, providing the result hash and storage location.
 * - `PollBridgedToEthereum`: Emitted when a poll's result is bridged to another chain, logging the poll ID
 *   and result hash.
 *
 * Errors:
 * - `P_UnauthorizedMetaTx`: Thrown when an unauthorized address attempts to handle meta-transactions.
 *
 * Modifiers:
 * - `onlyMetaTxHandler`: Restricts access to certain functions to the authorized meta-transaction handler.
 *
 * State Variables:
 * - `bridgeContract`: The address of the cross-chain bridge contract.
 * - `metaTxHandler`: The address authorized to handle meta-transactions.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Only the contract owner can set the bridge contract and meta-transaction handler.
 * - Voting and finalization actions are subject to various checks, including poll existence, voting eligibility,
 *   and finalization conditions.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Contract users can vote directly or through delegates, depending on eligibility.
 * - The meta-transaction handler facilitates gasless transactions.
 * - The owner can set a bridge contract to enable cross-chain operations, which bridges the result to a
 *   specified chain after poll finalization.
